*__This research introduces a method for predicting the mechanical performance and inverse design of Complex Cross-Sectional Columns (CCSCs) based on deep learning algorithms. A series of data-driven investigations were conducted from both forward prediction and inverse generation perspectives.__*

* ## **_Workflow_**

In this work, to evaluate the effectiveness of the prediction and generation methods, a substantial dataset of column cross-sections is required. Currently, such an extensive database is not readily available. Therefore, the MNIST-Section dataset was developed based on the MNIST dataset by mapping handwritten digits to fiber cross-sections. Subsequently, OpenSeesPy was employed to perform the computations, resulting in a fiber model dataset comprising 70,000 columns.
