*__The research introduces a novel framework for designing energy-dissipating walls by utilizing an inverse design method based on self-supervised diffusion models. SSIDM is established by integrating a generator (DiffEDW) and a discriminator (HPPN), which can generate EDW structures that meet the specified mechanical property targets based on the seismic performance demands of the structure.__*

* ## **_Workflow_**

In this work, a novel energy-dissipating system integrating non-structural infill walls and energy-dissipating walls (EDWs) is proposed to improve the seismic performance of frame-infill wall structures. Based on the diffusion model, a self-supervised inverse design model (SSIDM) is developed to enhance the design accuracy of complex EDWs.
